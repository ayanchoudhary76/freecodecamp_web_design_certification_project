# freecodecamp_web_design_certification_project
Here you will be getting code for all certification projects of web design on freecodecamp.org

Welcome!

In this project, I am providing solutions for all five certification projects on the topic of responsive web design from freecodecamp.org. Please go through the folders provided below in this project. Each folder contains ten files: five HTML files and their respective five CSS files.

Instead of copying and pasting, I request you to recreate the project by yourself. However, you can refer to this code when you encounter any issues. PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE CREATED CSS FILES WITH DIFFERENT NAMES, AND THUS, I HAVE CHANGED THEIR LINKS IN THE HTML FILES. So, if you try to copy and paste, these codes may not work.
